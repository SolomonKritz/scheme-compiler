## Overview

This is a compiler for a subset of scheme. It was largely written by myself, Solomon Kritz, over the course of the Fall 2017 Semester as part of UMD&apos;s [CMSC430](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2017/cmsc430/) course, although the testing and utils frameworks originated with Javran Cheng and [Professor Gilray](https://thomas.gilray.org/).

## Setup
* Install [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/Installation.html)
* Install [llvm and clang++](http://releases.llvm.org/)
* Install the [Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc)
* Clone this repository
* Change the variables libgc-path, gc-include-path, and clang++-path in utils.rkt to reflect the locations of libgc.a, the BDWGC include folder, and clang++.
* If using Windows, you may need to make slight changes to the function(s) eval-llvm and/or compile-llvm in utils.rkt as I developed this on linux.

## Usage

To compile a file, ensure it contains only forms from the input language below and has the extension .scm, then place it in the folder tests/compile/. At this point, running &quot;racket tests.rkt compile &lt;filename, excluding .scm extension&gt;&quot; will compile it to a binary named bin, as well as create a combined&#8203;.&#8203;ll file in LLVM IR.  

To write a test for the compiler, again create a program in the input language with the extension .scm. Place it in one of the folders in tests/ besides compile/. Running &quot;racket tests.rkt &lt;filename, excluding .scm extension&gt;&quot; will evaluate the program before compilation, compile it, and then evaluate the program again after compilation to ensure the results are the same.  

You can add more folders to tests/, just be sure to also add them to either the tests or to-compile functions in tests.rkt    

## Supported Input Language

**Note**: This language is a subset of Scheme, and all the forms below are the same as their Scheme counterparts except for defines. There is no support for top-level defines (i.e., all defines are treated as internal and desugared to letrec\*).

e ::= (define x e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (define (x x ... defaultparam ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| ( define (x x ... . x) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (letrec\* ([x e] ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (letrec ([x e] ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (let\* ([x e] ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (let ([x e] ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (let x ([x e] ...) e ...+)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (lambda x e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (lambda (x ...+ . x) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (dynamic-wind e e e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (guard (x cond-clause ...) e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (raise e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (delay e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (force e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (and e ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (or e ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (cond cond-clause ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (case e case-clause ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (if e e e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (when e e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (unless e e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (set! x e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (begin e ...+)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (call/cc e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (let/cc x e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (apply e e)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (e e ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| x  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| op  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (quasiquote qq)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| (quote dat)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| char | nat | string | #t | #f  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| e  

* cond-clause ::= (e) | (e e e ...) | (else e e ...)  
* case-clause ::= ((dat ...) e e ...) | (else e e ...)  
  * in all cases, else clauses must come last  
* dat is a datum satisfying datum? from utils.rkt  
* x is a variable (satisfies symbol?)  
* defaultparam ::= (x e)  
* op is a primitive from the list below.  
* qq ::= e | dat | (unquote qq) | (unquote e) | (quasiquote qq) | (qq ...+) | (qq ...+ . qq)  

## Supported Primitives

**Note**: All primitives are supported both using standard application and with a variadic apply version.

## Error Handling

This compiler is fairly weak in the error handling department. However, there are several classs of errors I do handle. First of all, the primitives functions check that they are given appropriate types and raise an error message if they are not. Additionally:  
* If one provides too many arguments to a function the program will halt with &quot;RUNTIME ERROR: Too many arguments provided to a function&quot; (string). This also works with primitive functions like map.  
* If one provides too few arguments to a function the program will halt with &quot;RUNTIME ERROR: Too few arguments provided to a function&quot; (string). However, this does not work with primitive functions or variadic argument functions.  
* If a non-function value is applied (e.g., (&quot;Not a Function&quot; 6) or (apply &quot;hey&quot; &apos;(6))) then the program will halt with &quot;RUNTIME ERROR: Cannot apply non-function value&quot;.  
* If one attempts to divide by zero, then the program will halt with &quot;RUNTIME ERROR: Cannot divide by zero&quot; (string).  
* If one attempts to access a vector index that is out of bounds, either by set! or ref, then the program will halt with a &quot;RUNTIME ERROR: Attempt to use a vector index that is out of bounds&quot; (string).  

Tests for the 5 bulleted errors above can be found in the tests/exceptions/ folder. The testing framework accounts for these errors by recognizing when the evaluation of the original scheme was throwing a corresponding error, catching it, and then returning the text of the applicable error above. More error cases can be added to the testing framework in the same manner.  

There are still many errors this compiler doesn&apos;t handle, or handle well. For instance, using string-ref or string set! to access an out of bounds index is not handled and will likely seg-fault. Trying to use an unitialized variable causes compilation to fail with a meaningless error message. There is no memory cap on programs that are compiled. Syntax errors typically fail to compile with a meaningless error. An attempt to use an unsupported primitive causes compilation to fail with an ugly, although comprehensible, message. etc.  

## Future Features

First and foremost I would like to add pattern-matching. This is a key-feature in any functional programming language. I am not sure how feasible adding top-level defines would be, but that would be good to look into as well. Next I would like to add a better system for errors than just halting, and add more types of exceptions with more dynamic messages. After that I would like to add more data-structures. Currently there are lists and vectors, but that&apos;s it. Professor Gilray recommended adding functional hash-maps and/or hash-sets with HAMT, and it would also be good to add mutable hash-sets. Finally, it is important to work on efficiency, as I was primarily focused on getting this to work over anything else, and it shows in that there is *a lot* of bloat.
